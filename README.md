# WConnect-prototype
A website summarising the human-centered design my team and I went through from ideation to feedback to implementation for a mobile app prototype. We have built an interface where Wellesley students of all backgrounds can connect with each other and feel a little less lonely. Students, especially first-years who are brought into this new enviornment would benefit knowing that members of the community are accessible. With this app, students will be able to develop relationships with students and professors from similar backgrounds, and find student clubs they're interested in.
